# TestClangLLVM
Clang/LLVM project
This project is a simple test program for using clang/llvm. 

Currently it depends on CLion, MSYS2, and MinGW-W64. clang and llvm will have to be added via pacman.
This URL - http://blog.johannesmp.com/2015/09/01/installing-clang-on-windows-pt3/ is paticularly useful on setting up clang & llvm.
As stated, this is currently only a CLion project. The CMakeLists.txt is paeticularly important.

In the future I will set this up as a Visual Studio project that uses Clang/LLVM for Windows.
